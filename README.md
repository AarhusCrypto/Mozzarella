# `twopac`: A rust library for secure two-party computation

The `twopac` library implements various garbled-circuit-based secure two-party
computation (2PC) protocols:

* The standard semi-honest 2PC protocol.
* The publicly verifiable covert 2PC protocol of Hong-Katz-Kolesnikov-Lu-Wang (coming soon!).
* The "authenticated garbling" malicious 2PC protocol of Wang-Ranellucci-Katz (coming soon!).

**`twopac` should be considered unstable and under active development until
version 1.0 is released**
