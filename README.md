# The `scuttlebutt` multi-party computation utilities toolkit
Or: "Where rust MPC libraries come to drink"

The `scuttlebutt` library provides a bunch of core primitives for building
multi-party computation (MPC) related protocols, such as garbled circuits or
oblivious transfer.

**`scuttlebutt` should be considered unstable and under active development until
version 1.0 is released**

# Building

Use `cargo build` to build, `cargo test` to run the test suite, `cargo bench` to
benchmark the various protocols, and `cargo doc --open` to view documentation.

`scuttlebutt` also supports the following features:

* `nightly`: Use nightly features from `rust` and the underlying libraries.
