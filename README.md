# The `scuttlebutt` multi-party computation utilities toolkit [![](https://travis-ci.org/amaloz/scuttlebutt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/amaloz/scuttlebutt)
Or: "Where rust MPC libraries come to drink"

The `scuttlebutt` library provides a bunch of core primitives for building
multi-party computation (MPC) related protocols, such as garbled circuits or
oblivious transfer. In particular, `scuttlebutt` provides the following:

* `Aes128` and `Aes256` provide AES encryption capabilities using AES-NI.
* `AesHash`, which provides a correlation-robust hash function based on fixed-key AES (cf. <https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/074>).
* `AesRng`, which provides a random number generator based on fixed-key AES.
* `Block`, which wraps a 128-bit value and provides methods useful when used as a garbled circuit wire label.
* `Block512`, which wraps a 512-bit value and provides methods operating on that value.
* A `cointoss` module, which implements a simple random-oracle-based coin-tossing protocol.
* A `comm` module, which contains `Read`/`Write` objects for tracking the number of bits read/written.
* A `utils` module, which contains useful utility functions.

**`scuttlebutt` should be considered unstable and under active development until
version 1.0 is released**

# Building

Use `cargo build` to build, `cargo test` to run the test suite, `cargo bench` to
benchmark the various protocols, and `cargo doc --open` to view documentation.

`scuttlebutt` also supports the following features:

* `nightly`: Use nightly features from `rust` and the underlying libraries.
* `curve25519-dalek`: Enable functions that use `curve25519-dalek`.
* `serde`: Enable `serde` support.
