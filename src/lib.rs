//! `popsicle` is a private set intersection (PSI) library written in rust.
//!
//! `popsicle` exposes PSI through two traits: `PrivateSetIntersectionSender`
//! and `PrivateSetIntersectionReceiver`. Each trait has an `init` function
//! which runs any one-time initialization, and a `send` / `receive` function,
//! which computes the set intersection.
//!
//! `popsicle` currently supports the following instantiations of the PSI traits:
//!
//! * The Pinkas-Schneider-Zohner PSI protocol (cf.
//! <https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/447>), including optimizations as specified by
//! Kolesnikov-Kumaresan-Rosulek-Trieu (cf. <https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/799>).
//!
//! **THIS IS STILL VERY MUCH RESEARCH CODE**, for now.
