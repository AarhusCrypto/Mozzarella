//! `scuttlebutt` is a library of primitives for use in multi-party computation
//! protocols.
//!
//! `scuttlebutt` provides the following:
//! * `AesHash`, which provides a correlation-robust hash function based on
//! fixed-key AES (cf. <https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/074>).
//! * `AesRng`, which provides a random number generator based on fixed-key AES.
//! * `Block`, which wraps an `__m128i` type and provides methods useful
//! when used as a garbled circuit wire label.
