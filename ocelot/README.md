# `ocelot`: A rust library for oblivious transfer

The `ocelot` library implements various one-out-of-two oblivious transfer (+
extension) protocols in rust, alongside oblivious pseudorandom function
protocols inspired by OT. It's the coolest cat in the oblivious transfer world.

`ocelot` implements the following oblivious transfer (OT) protocols:

* [Naor-Pinkas](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/301250.301312) semi-honest OT.
* [Chou-Orlandi](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/267) malicious OT (including a fix
  for a security flaw in the existing protocol write-up).
* [Asharov-Lindell-Schneider-Zohner](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/602)
  semi-honest OT extension (+ correlated and random OT).
* [Keller-Orsini-Scholl](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/546) malicious OT
  extension (+ correlated and random OT).

And the following oblivious (programmable) PRF protocols:

* [Kolesnikov-Kumaresan-Rosulek-Trieu](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/799) OPRF.
* [Kolesnikov-Matania-Pinkas-Rosulek-Trieu](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/799)
  OPPRF.

It also exposes various traits for implementing your very own OT or OPRF
protocol.

**`ocelot` should be considered unstable with potential API changes until
version 1.0 is released**

# Performance

`ocelot` seems to be close in performance with the latest and greatest OT
libraries out there. When running the benchmarks with `1 << 23` OTs we get the
following results (in # million OTs per second and using Chou-Orlandi as the
base OT):

| Protocol |   OT |  COT |  ROT |
|----------|------|------|------|
| ALSZ     | 10.3 | 11.8 | 15.5 |
| KOS      |  8.7 | 10.0 | 11.1 |

For our base OT protocols, we get the following results (in time to run 128
OTs):

| Protocol     | Running Time |
|--------------|--------------|
| Naor-Pinkas  | 21.9 ms      |
| Chou-Orlandi | 12.7 ms      |

For the OPRFs, we get the following (in # million OPRFs per second and using
Chou-Orlandi as the base OT) when running the benchmarks with `1 << 18` OPRFs:

| Protocol | OPRF |
|----------|------|
| KKRT     |  1.3 |

All results use unix streams and were run on a 2.7 GHz machine with 16 GB RAM,
with the sender and receiver run on different threads (see `benches/ot.rs` for
details), using the `nightly` feature (see below).

# Building

Use `cargo build` to build, `cargo test` to run the test suite, and `cargo
bench` to benchmark the various protocols.

`ocelot` also supports the following features:

* `nightly`: Use nightly features from `rust` and the underlying libraries.

* `unstable`: Enable unstable components of `ocelot`.
